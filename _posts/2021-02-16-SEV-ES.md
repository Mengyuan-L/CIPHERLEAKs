# SEV Encrypted State (SEV-ES)

AMD later released the second generation SEV-ES [2] in February, 2017. SEV-ES is designed to protect the register states during the world switch and introduces the VMSA to store the register states encrypted by $K_{vek}$.

## Non-Automatic VM Exits

Because SEV-ES encrypts the register states during VMEXITs. AMD modifies the scheme used to handle VMEXITs. VMEXITs in SEV-ES  are now classified as either Automatic VM Exits (AE) or Non-Automatic VM Exits (NAE). AE VMEXITs are events that do not need to expose any register state to the hypervisor. These events include machine check exception, physical interrupt, physical Non-Maskable-Interrupt, physical Init, virtual interrupt, pause instruction, \texttt{hlt} instruction, shutdown, write trap of CR[0-15], Nested page fault, invalid guest state, busy bit, and VMGEXIT [1]. All other VMEXITs are classified as NAE VMEXITs, which require exposing some register values to the hypervisor.

Instead of being trapped directly by the hypervisor, NAE events first result in a VC exception, which is handled by a VC handler inside the guest VM. The VC handler then inspects the NAE event's error code and decides which registers need to be exposed to the hypervisor. The VC handler copies those registers' states to a special structure called Guest-Hypervisor Communication Block (GHCB), which is a shared memory region between the guest and the hypervisor. 

After copying those necessary registers' states to GHCB, the VC handler executes a *VMGEXIT* instruction to trigger an AE VMEXIT. The hypervisor then traps the VMGEXIT VMEXIT, reads those states from the GHCB, handles the VMEXIT, writes the return registers' states into GHCB if needed, and executes a VMRUN. After the VMRUN, the guest VM's execution will resume after the *VMGEXIT* instruction inside the VC handler, which copies the return values from GHCB to the corresponding registers, and then exits the VC handler.

For example, to handle *CPUID* instructions, the VC handler stores the states of RAX and RCX and the VM EXITCODE (0x72 for CPUID) into GHCB and executes a *VMGEXIT*. The hypervisor then emulates the CPUID instruction and updates the values of RAX, RBX, RCX, and RDX in GHCB. After VMRUN, the VC handler checks if those return registers' states are valid and copies those states to its internal registers.
