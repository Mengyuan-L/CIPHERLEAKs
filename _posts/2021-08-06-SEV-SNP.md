# SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP）

To address the attacks against SEV that exploit memory integrity flaws, AMD recently announced SEV-SNP and released a whitepaper describing its high-level functionality in January, 2020 [1].

The source code for SEV-SNP software support can be found [here](https://github.com/AMDESE/AMDSEV/tree/sev-snp-devel).  

## Reverse Map Table (RMP)

SEV-SNP [1] protects guest VM's memory integrity by introducing a new structure called Reverse Map Table (RMP). Each RMP entry is indexed by the system page frame numbers; it contains the page states (e.g., page's ownership, guest-valid, guest-invalid, and guest physical address) of this system page frame. The SEV-SNP VM must interact with the hypervisor to validate each RMP entry. Specifically, the guest VM needs to issue a new instruction ***PVALIDATE***, a new instruction for guest VMs, to validate a guest physical address before the first access to that guest physical address. Any memory access to an invalid guest physical address will result in an NPF. More importantly, once a guest page is validated, the hypervisor cannot modify the RMP entry. Therefore, the guest VM itself can guarantee that its memory page is only validated once, and a one-to-one mapping between the guest physical address and system physical address mapping can be maintained.

As shown in the figure, RMP limits the hypervisor's capabilities of managing NPT. The RMP check is performed before the NPT walk is finished.

Without RMP check, the hypervisor can easily remap guest physical address (gPA) to an arbitrary memory page by manipulating the page table entry in the NPT. With RMP check, if the hypervisor remaps the guest physical address to a memory page not belonging to the current guest VM or a memory page mapped to the current guest VM's other guest physical address, an invalid NPF or a mismatch NPF will be triggered, which can prevent attacks that require modification of the NPT [2,3].

## Ownership Check

After each nested page table walks that leads to a system physical page belonging to an SEV-SNP VM (and also some other cases), an RMP check is to be performed. The RMP check compares the owner of the page (e.g., the ASID)) with the current ASID and compares the recorded gPA in the RMP entry with the gPA of the current nPT walk. If a mismatch is detected, a nested page fault will be triggered. Another protection enabled by the ownership check is that the ownership included in the RMP entry restricts the hypervisor's write permission towards the guest VM's private memory, which can prevent attacks that require directly modifying the ciphertext [4,5]. You may refer to SEV Vulnerabilities for more details.
