Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is an emerging processor feature available in recent AMD processors that encrypts the entire memory of virtual machines (VM) transparently. Memory encryption is performed by a hardware memory encryption engine (MEE) embedded in the memory controller that encrypts memory traffic on the fly, with a key unique to each of the VMs. As the encryption keys are generated from random sources at the time of VM launches and are securely protected inside the secure processor in their lifetime, privileged software, including the hypervisor, is not able to extract the keys and use them to decrypt the VMs' memory content. Therefore, SEV enables a stronger threat model, where the hypervisor is removed from the trusted computing base (TCB). It is explicitly stated in AMDâ€™s SEV whitepaper\cite{kaplan:2016:sevWpaper} that ``SEV technology is built around a threat model where an attacker is assumed to have access to not only execute user level privileged code on the target machine, but can potentially execute malware at the higher privileged hypervisor level as well.'' Hence, SEV provides a trusted execution environment (TEE) for (mostly) unmodified VMs to perform confidential computation that is shielded from strong adversaries that control the entire privileged software stack.
