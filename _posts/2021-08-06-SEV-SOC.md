# SEV system-on-chip (Secure Processor)

Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) is an emerging processor feature available in recent AMD processors that encrypts the entire memory of virtual machines (VM) transparently. 

Memory encryption is performed with the help of AMD system-on-chip (SOC). Besides the CPU, a secure processor (dubbed AMD-SP) that is in charge of generating and maintaining the ephemeral memory encryption keys and a hardware memory encryption engine (MEE) that encrypts memory traffic on the fly are embedded in the SOC. The memory encryption keys are generated from random sources at the time of VM launches and are securely protected inside the AMD-SP in their lifetime, privileged software, including the hypervisor, is not able to extract the keys and use them to decrypt the VMs' memory content. Those components consist of the hardware bases of AMD memory encryption.
